# Angular Style Showcase

## Project Description

The Angular Style Showcase is a demonstration application built using Angular CLI to showcase proficiency in Angular project structure, component-based architecture, and advanced SCSS features. This project includes a responsive layout with a custom theme system and advanced CSS preprocessing techniques such as variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and extend/inheritance. The application consists of a header, footer, main content area, and child components, with one custom Angular directive and lazy-loaded modules.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Theming**: Includes a light and dark theme system using SCSS.
- **Advanced SCSS Techniques**:
  - **Variables**: Used for colors, fonts, and spacing for consistency and easy maintenance.
  - **Nesting**: Utilized for component-specific styles.
  - **Mixins**: Created reusable style patterns (e.g., flexbox layouts, button styles).
  - **Functions**: Custom functions for dynamic value calculations (e.g., converting px to rem).
  - **Extend/Inheritance**: Shared common styles among components.
  - **Partials**: Organized styles into separate files for better maintainability.
- **Custom Directive**: Includes a custom Angular directive with host binding for dynamic styling.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented for at least one module to optimize application performance.
- **Angular CLI**: Used for generating components, directives, services, building for production, running unit tests, and linting the codebase.

## Setup and Run Instructions

To set up and run the Angular Style Showcase application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd angular-style-showcase


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
